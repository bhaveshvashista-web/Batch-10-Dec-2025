Insurance Charges Analysis

This project analyzes an insurance dataset to explore factors that influence medical insurance charges, such as age, gender, BMI, children, smoking habits, and region. Using Python and data visualization libraries, the project provides insights into how personal and lifestyle factors affect healthcare costs.

📌 Project Overview

The main objectives of this project are:

Perform data cleaning and preprocessing.
Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify trends and patterns.
Visualize relationships between variables like BMI vs. Charges, Smoker vs. Non-Smoker, and Region-wise distribution.
Build insights that can help insurance companies in risk assessment and pricing strategies.


🛠️ Technologies & Libraries Used
Python
NumPy & Pandas → Data handling and preprocessing
Matplotlib & Seaborn → Data visualization and statistical plots
Scikit-learn (optional, if you add ML model later)


📊 Key Insights
Smoking status has the largest impact on charges (smokers pay significantly more).
BMI is positively correlated with charges, indicating obesity risk.
Age is a strong predictor, with older individuals generally paying higher premiums.
Regional differences exist but are less significant compared to lifestyle factors.
